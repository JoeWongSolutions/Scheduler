## Technologies
We created our database using MySQL, and implemented PHP and HTML with Apache to create our webpages. We used Bootstrap as our styler for our webpages. We used Amazon Web Services as our host.

## Methodologies
We utilized the Agile Processes and Procedures, and the Scrum Process as described in this Readme below. We utilized the methodology of Paired Programming when we were able to meet together as a complete group on our Tuesday and Thursday meetings. We also utilized the Kanban Board in our Axosoft planning.

## The Scrum Team
Our whole group consists of five members: Joe Wong, Adam Oakes, Will Smith, Alex Parr, and Camille Fraizer.
  * Product Owner: We designated Joe Wong as our Product Owner at the beginning of the project. 
  * Scrum Master: For our project, we thought it would be a good idea to let multiple members take turns being the Scrum Master in order to get a feel for what the position would be like in a real situation. Our Scrum Masters went as follows: Alex Parr, Adam Oakes, Alex Parr, Will Smith.
  * Development Team: The Development Team consisted of all members of the group.

## The Sprint
Our Sprints always consisted of a timeframe of two weeks. We had a total of four Sprints, giving this project a timeframe of two months.

## Sprint Planning
Sprint Planning was done every Tuesday in our meetings. We would assign our new Scrum Master for that Sprint and then delegate out stories to be put into the next Sprint, as well as delegate out the owner of the stories.

## Daily Scrum Meetings
We had to take a different approach to our Daily Scrum meetings. Most days of the week, our schedules conflicted too much that we simply were not able to meet together every day of the sprint in order to do the Daily Scrum. To work around this conflict, we initiated a group message where we would ask the Daily Scrum questions. These messages were sent within a timeframe so as to conform to the 15 minute timeframe of the Daily Scrum. The days that we were able to meet up were Tuesdays and Thursdays after our  Software Engineering course. We would start off our meetings with the Daily Scrum questions, and spent no longer than 6 minutes going through the group. Of course, the three questions were always the same:
  1. What did you do yesterday?
  2. What will you do today?
  3. Are there any obstacles you are facing?
  
## Sprint Reviews
We ended every Sprint bi-weekly on Tuesdays. On these Tuesday meetings, we would give a brief demo of the functionality of the Scheduler as had been completed. 

## Sprint Retrospective
We would end our Tuesday meetings with our Retrospectives. This required the whole team to be together. We would discuss among ourselves how we felt that the last Sprint went and what features were necessary to complete the project. We trimmed the backlog a few times to fit in functionality we thought necessary to meet a "completed/working" product.

## Scrum Artifacts
 * The Product Backlog
 Initial creation of the Product Backlog took place at the very beginning of Sprint 1. As we progressed through our project, we created more stories that would be necessary to create our product. 
 * The Sprint Backlog
 
   Sprint 1: The first sprint backlog included all of our Use Case Descriptions as needed for the project.  
   Sprint 2: This backlog included basic funtionality for the project to get it into a "completed/working" product. This included logging in and viewing our Schedule page.  
   Sprint 3: This backlog was a variety of functionality that we thought were necessary to implement to achieve our idea of what would make the product "completed/working", involving not only remaining basic functionality but also features more complicated but ideal for the product.  
   Sprint 4: This backlog included all remaining stories and documenting the project.
